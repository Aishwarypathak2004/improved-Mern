// Generally there are two tyeps of package installation 
1 loacal : it means if a package is installed locally can only be used in the folder they have installed in.
2. global : It means if a package is installed globally! we can use it anywhere within the project no mater which folder of the project it is installed in 
generally  we install package locally because it is considered a good practise but for knowledge the command for global installation of a package is
npm install -g <Package name>
and then we gotta link the package by 
npm link <package name>
